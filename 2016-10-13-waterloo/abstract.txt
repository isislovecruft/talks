Title: Hacks and Improvement for Tor's Circuit-Layer Crypto

Abstract: Since 2010, various nation state adversaries have been conducting
active probing and enumeration attacks to attempt to collect all of Tor's
bridges, the unpublished entrances to the Tor network which are used to
circumvent online censorship.  Since then, an arms race to distribute the
bridge addresses to honest clients without these adversaries obtaining them
has ensued.  The proposed solution uses attribute-based credentials to record
honest users' good behaviour (i.e. the bridges not being censored/blocked),
which also serves to effectively lock censoring adversaries out of the
distribution system.  Even with these measures being implemented, there are
other schemes for discovering the locations of Tor bridges; these will be
discussed, as well as a hack that can be done with Tor's circuit-layer
cryptography to protect against it.  After that, I'll discuss a known tagging
attack on Tor and a much-needed (and highly custom) authenticating encryption
cipher to defend against it, as well as the design for a post-quantum hybrid
Tor handshake I've been working on.
