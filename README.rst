This repository is for resources such as slides and supplementary materials from
talks I've given on my work.  There's no promise that I'll keep it complete or
up-to-date, but I'll try to generally make materials available sometime the day
the talk is given.

Talks
========

* **2016 March 21**: See the `2016-03-21-raboud` directory for slides.

  Guest lecture on the history and current status of mixnets, anonymity
  networks, and anonymous communcations systems, given at `Raboud Unversiteit
  <ru.nl>`_ in Nijmegen to students following the `TRU/e Computer Security
  Master's Programme <https://www.true-security.nl/>`_.

* **2016 February 02**: See the `2016-02-02-raboud` directory for slides.

  Talk given to graduate students, researchers, and faculty of the Digital
  Security group at the `Institute for Computing and Information Sciences
  <http://www.ru.nl/icis/>`_ at `Raboud Unversiteit <ru.nl>`_ in Nijmegen, the
  Netherlands, concerning my work with `The Tor Project
  <https://www.torproject.org>`_ on protecting Tor bridges from discovery by
  nation-state adversaries.

* **2015 December 11**: See the `2015-12-11-eipsi` directory for slides.

  I `spoke <https://www.win.tue.nl/eipsi/cwg/aank%20dec%202015.pdf>`_ to the
  `Cryptography Working Group <https://www.win.tue.nl/eipsi/seminars_cwg.html>`_
  at the `Eindhoven Institute for the Protection of Systems and Information
  <http://www.win.tue.nl/eipsi>`_ (part of `Wiskunden en Informatica
  <https://www.tue.nl/universiteit/faculteiten/wiskunde-informatica/>`_ at
  `Technisches Universiteit Eindhoven <https://www.tue.nl/>`_) in Utrecht, the
  Netherlands, about the cryptography for my current work on using pairing-based
  anonymous credential schemes for social distribution of Tor bridge relays.

* **2015 October 12**:

  I spoke about Tor's circuits, path selection, and hidden services, (and the
  basics of the cryptography for those things) at a women's-only `event held at
  ThoughtWorks' Werkstatt Berlin
  <http://www.meetup.com/de/ThoughtWorks-Technology-Radar-Briefing-Berlin/events/226058216/>`_
  space. (It was neither my choice nor my preference to restrict attendance by
  sex.  It was also unclear to me if their definition of "women" meant "born
  female," as I suspect, or if they hopefully meant some more inclusive
  definition such as "anyone who isn't a cis-gendered male.")
